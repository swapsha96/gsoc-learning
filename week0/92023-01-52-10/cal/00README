Updating your Cal directory

In your Cal/Day0000 subdirectory, there should be a file the name of which is
a date, like "1997June18". At the legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov FTP site you will
find the calibration tar file cal1.tar which should have a similar creation
date. If the date at the ftp site is more recent than the one in your
database, it is time to renew following the recipe.

Directories:

You should either have or create the FD/Cal/Day0000
directories in your XTE database. (This isn't absolutely necessary, of
course, but these recipes assume the structure is there. If you want to do
it another way, set your calibration database environment variables
accordingly following the example below.)

Steps:

  1. Download cal1.tar by anonymous FTP from legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov, directory
     xte/calib_data (binary transfer!).

  2. Set the environment variable XFDB giving the full path to the top of
     your XTE database, i.e. the FD directory:

         setenv XFDB /blah/blah/FD

  3. Go into the Day0000 directory, delete its old contents, and untar the
     cal1.tar file (giving the path to wherever you downloaded it):.

         cd $XFDB/Cal
         rm -rf Day0000
         tar xvf /...path.../cal1.tar

  4. Set the appropriate environment variables either by hand:

         setenv CALDB $XFDB/Cal/Day0000
         setenv CALDBCONFIG $CALDB/caldb.config
         setenv CALDBALIAS ./

     or by using the XTECALDB file found in the same directory on the FTP
     site and within the tar file:

         source XTECALDB

  5. Create (if it does not already exist) the top level FMI file. For
     instance,

         cd $XFDB
         cp AO1/P00033/FMI .
         recofmi dirpath=$XFDB level=2 delete=yes

     (For details, see the Database Management recipe.)

An alternative for the steps 3 and 4, if you prefer to install the cal1 file
in directory /foo/bar, independently from your XTE database:

  3.    cd /foo/bar
        tar xvf /cal1.tar

  4.    setenv CALDB /foo/bar
        setenv CALDBCONFIG $CALDB/caldb.config
        setenv CALDBALIAS ./

NOTE: In either case you may want to include steps 2 and 4 in your .login
file so that these variables are set automatically when you log in.
